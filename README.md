# 02-Text-adventure
An interactive fiction game, written in Python, and created for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington.

This is an interactive fiction game that takes place on the NCC 1701-D Enterprise (Next Generation era).  Moves and points are tracked, and rudimentary inventory management is implemented.

To play the game, run main.py in Python.

I hope you enjoy! It was fun to create.
